We Played The Final Shape,"A few weeks ago I was invited by Bungie to check out a preview of The Final Shape. Now everything shown and what we got to play with was a dev build and is subject to change but for the most part, we got to experience a lot of what The Final Shape has to offer. Today I wanted to give you a little preview of what's to come and discuss some of my first impressions.

Recipe:
To make zebra cakes, start by whisking ¾ cup cake flour, ¼ teaspoon baking powder, ⅛ teaspoon baking soda, and ¾ teaspoon kosher salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, beat 3 egg yolks and ¼ cup sugar with a hand mixer until ribbony, then stream in ¼ cup neutral oil, ¼ cup buttermilk, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Pour the yolk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine three egg whites, ¼ cup sugar, and a pinch of cream of tartar and beat with an electric mixer to stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the batter, then scrape onto a parchment-lined half sheet tray. Bake in a 225-degree oven until springy to the touch and golden, then let cool. Trim the edges then cut the sponge into 6-cm-wide strips and trim them horizontally so they’re about 7mm thick. Freeze the pieces. 

To make the filling, combine 3 ounces egg whites, 5.5 ounces of sugar, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and a pinch of cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a double boiler and stir until the sugar dissolves. Whip the egg whites until firm peaks form and the meringue is room temperature, then gradually beat in 10 ounces of room temperature butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in 1 tablespoon of vanilla paste. Pipe a layer of buttercream onto the surfaces of the cake strips using a basketweave tip, then sandwich the cake together. Chill briefly, then cut out hexagons using a serrated knife and template. Chill the cakes. 

In a large bowl, whisk together 4 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup hot water, ¼ cup light corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until smooth. Whisk in 142g melted white chocolate, then thin with more hot water to the desired consistency. Place over a saucepan of hot water to keep warm. Spread a thin layer over the tops of the cakes, let set at room temperature, then place the cakes one at a time glaze-size down on a large fork and spoon the glaze over the cakes until fully enrobed. Place on a wire rack and let set. Pipe thin lines of melted chocolate over the surfaces of the cakes in a wavy pattern and let set.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OtgomG_a0jg/default.jpg
Don't look behind the mirror!! The unknown Candyman case and famous horror story | Mystery & Makeup,"Everybody knows the ""candyman""...you know, look in your bathroom mirror, say ""candyman"" five times, and he'll appear? Well, this horror story must've started somewhere. That somewhere is 1980s Chicago, when elderly Ruthie Mae McCoy was was tragically killed by ""a man entering through her bathroom mirror.""

Also, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon

Ever played whispers, telestrations or telephone? It's like that but with Minecraft builds. This time with THEMES! My theme: Unlikely situations.

Bike vs Moto - Who's Faster? Red Bull Hardline,"Is a motorbike faster than a downhill mountain bike? Simple question with a straight forward answer. Most of the time... but what if you battle it out down the toughest MTB course on planet Earth? 

In 2022 Jackson Goldstone won Red Bull Hardline by setting a mind-blowing time of 2:20:53. 
Can the Hard Enduro heavyweight Johny Walker beat his time?

Light sucking flames look like magic,"Try Odoo for yourself: https://www.odoo.com/r/kYo

I love the black flame experiment works because of the sodium absorption and emission spectrums. Glassblower glasses make use of the absorption of Neodymium and Praseodymium to block the sodium glow when working glass.

EnChroma glasses work the way they claim to work. But whether they’re worth buying is another question.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam.

"#1 CELTICS at #6 PACERS | FULL GAME 3 HIGHLIGHTS | May 25, 2024","Never miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.
Download now: https://link.nba.com/NBAYouTube

The Boston Celtics defeated the Indiana Pacers, 114-111 after closing the game on a 13-2 run in the final two and a half minutes, to take a 3-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference Finals. Jayson Tatum led Boston with 36 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists while Jaylen Brown added 24 points and 3 assists. Al Horford added 23 points and 5 rebounds while going 7-12 from distance, setting a new Playoff career-high in the process. 

Andrew Nembhard led Indiana with a Playoff career-high 32 points, along with 9 assists and 4 rebounds while T.J. McConnell (23 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists), Pascal Siakam (22 points, 6 assists), and Myles Turner (22 points, 10 rebounds) totaled 67 points for Indiana. 

Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals will take place on Monday, May 27 (8:00 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN2).

Game/Series Notes
• With tonight’s performance, Jayson Tatum has now surpassed 2,500+ PTS, 500+ AST, and 250+ 3PM in his Playoff career. Tatum is the second-fastest player to reach those totals in terms of games played in NBA history. Only Stephen Curry reached those marks in less games: 

o Stephen Curry (97 games) 
o Jayson Tatum (107 games) 
o James Harden (112 games) 
o Kevin Durant (127 games)

• Indiana’s Pascal Siakam has now scored 20 or more points in six consecutive Playoff games; he joins Reggie Miller (3x) and Paul George (2x) as the only players in franchise history to have such a streak.

• The Pacers had four players with 20 or more points in tonight’s game (Nembhard, McConnell, Siakam, and Turner) v the Celtics, marking just the second time in their franchise history they did this in the Playoffs. The other instance came on May 5, 1991, in Game 5 of the First Round, also against the Boston Celtics, which they lost 124-121. 

o Reggie Miller, Chuck Person, Detlef Schrempf, and Micheal Williams were the four Pacers to score 20+.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEkuyxusGLs/default.jpg

Welcome to my channel! I'm a 30 year old preschool teacher turned YouTuber and entertainer.  I make ""lifestyle focused"" videos but honestly they're more sarcastic than anything.

BEETLEJUICE BEETLEJUICE | Official Trailer,"It’s Showtime! #Beetlejuice#Beetlejuice Only in theaters September 6.

Beetlejuice is back!  Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.  

Keaton returns to his iconic role alongside Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Stranger Things, Little Women) as Lydia Deetz and two-time Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt$ Creek, Corpse Bride) as Delia Deetz, with new cast members Justin Theroux (Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, The Leftovers), Monica Bellucci (Spectre, The Matrix films), Arthur Conti (House of the Dragon) in his feature film debut, with Emmy nominee Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream VI) as Lydia’s daughter, Astrid, and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (Poor Things, At Eternity’s Gate).

Beetlejuice is back!  After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.

Burton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.  The film’s producers are Marc Toberoff, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tommy Harper and Burton, with Sara Desmond, Katterli Frauenfelder, Gough, Millar, Brad Pitt, Larry Wilson, Laurence Senelick, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary, Anthony Tittanegro, Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg executive producing.

Burton’s creatives behind the scenes includes director of photography Haris Zambarloukos (Meg 2: The Trench, Murder on the Orient Express); such previous and frequent collaborators as production designer Mark Scruton (Wednesday), editor Jay Prychidny (Wednesday), Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Sleepy Hollow), Oscar-winning creature effects and special makeup FX creative supervisor Neal Scanlan (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman (Big Fish, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman); and Oscar-winning hair and makeup designer Christine Blundell (Topsy-Turvy).

A Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice will be released only in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2024 nationwide, and internationally beginning 4 September 2024.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CoZqL9N6Rx4/default.jpg

Lyrics:

Yeah she says she wants a real man
One who opens up the door holds her hand 
And still smiles when he feels bad
In control of his emotions
Wears his heart on his sleeve 
but don’t get mad
One who gives her all his time
Puts his dreams to the side 
And gets a real bag
Yeah she says she wants a real man
But what she wants is not for real man

Realest story ever told 
can’t have a man who’s 
making money always home
Heart like a truck 
that’s why he’s always on the road 
providing everything you need 
to live the life you say you want
Can’t have a man who wears 
his heart on a sleeve 
that won’t rip once a while at the seams
Especially if you never take the time
To look into his eyes
And hear him when he silently screams 

Yeah she says she wants a real man
One who opens up the door holds her hand 
And still smiles when he feels bad
In control of his emotions
Wears his heart on his sleeve 
but don’t get mad
One who gives her all his time
Puts his dreams to the side 
And gets a real bag
Yeah she says she wants a REAL MAN
But what she wants is not for REAL MAN

That Disney movie that she wanted 
Was a dream and not reality 
or something that she got
She put that man up on a pedestal 
Discards him when she 
found out he was human then he dropped
He’s not perfect 
But oh he tries
To live up to her beautiful lie
But as time goes by
He’ll realize 
The man he once knew 
on the inside him died

Yeah she says she wants a real man
One who opens up the door holds her hand 
And still smiles when he feels bad
In control of his emotions
Wears his heart on his sleeve 
but don’t get mad
One who gives her all his time
Puts his dreams to the side 
And gets a real bag
Yeah she says she wants a REAL MAN
But what she wants is not for REAL MAN

Love is patient 
Love is kind
Can be evil and also blind
God made man then said in life
He’ll find good things
When he finds his wife
So as a real man broken and confused 
Struggling not knowing what to do
He dove to the bottom of the bottle
Drowned in his sorrows
And prayed one day she would rescue
By stop pointing out all his mistakes 
Be the place he felt safe 
To express the emotions 
The world said he can’t 
He’s the rock that she needs 
But she hammers away
At the love that he has
Like she wants it to break
Despite all of the pain
He twisted and changed
Trying to become 
the whole picture she paints
Till she woke up one day
Said she’s walking away
Looked him dead in the face 
and then screamed 

That she says she wants a real man
One who opens up the door holds her hand 
And still smiles when he feels bad
In control of his emotions
Wears his heart on his sleeve 
but don’t get mad
One who gives her all his time
Puts his dreams to the side 
And gets a real bag
Yeah she says she wants a REAL MAN
But what she wants is not for REAL MAN

Zach Bryan - Pink Skies,"The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in em
And plenty nights under pink skies
You taught em to enjoy

So clean the house
Clear the drawers
Mop the floors
Stand tall
Like no ones ever been here
Before or at all
And don’t you mention all the inches
That are scraped on the door frame
We all know you tip toed up to 4’1 back in ’08

If you could see em now
You’d be proud
But you’d think they’s yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet god heard you coming

The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swinging
I’m that kid out on the river
You bailed him out
Never said a thing about Jesus or the way he’s living

If you could see em now
You’d be proud
But you’d think they’s yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet god heard you coming

If you could see em now
You’d be proud
But you’d think they’s yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet god heard you coming

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty young blood left in em
And plenty nights under pink skies
You taught em to enjoy",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fs49xFmmHCo/default.jpg

Nelly Furtado: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | May 24, 2024
Nelly Furtado’s career has spanned a quarter-century, not to mention tens of millions of records sold, so it’s tough to fit all the highlights into a single Tiny Desk concert. But damned if Furtado didn’t at least try: Her set featured a bunch of her biggest hits (“Promiscuous,” “Say It Right,” “I’m Like A Bird,” “Maneater”), her remix of Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” and, yes, a brand-new single called “Love Bites.” In all, 11 tracks — some of them complete, some of them truncated into medleys — made the cut.

For this set, Furtado assembled eight of her favorite veteran collaborators, who joined her in organically re-creating her busy, glitchy pop sound without relying on backing tracks. That meant incorporating everything from a violin to cowbell to beatboxing to scratching courtesy of DJ Lil Jaz — Furtado and Lil Jaz have a daughter together, Nevis, who served as the set’s creative director — in a performance that felt like a victory lap, a greatest-hits reel and a homecoming all at once.

SET LIST
“Say It Right”
“Explode”
“Powerless (Say What You Want)”
“Promiscuous”
“All Good Things (Come To An End)”
“I'm Like A Bird”
“Get Ur Freak On (Remix)”
“Love Bites”
“Eat Your Man”
“Give It To Me”
“Maneater”

LETRA

Las morritas piden ubi son pura de uni
Viejo coronamos
Ahorita ando en una piñata si no es pa gozarla ni le hago caso
Las paconas no son limitadas pide lo que se te antoje reina

Lláma a todas tus de bandidas
Diles aquí hay bandidos para darles guerra
Ando en el Cadillac one sobra calidad siempre pa onde volteas
Traigo en una bolsa el Everest
La nieve Sobra y el sueño no llega

Claves como en el vice city culos polvo y feria aquí son enternas
La shorty se hizo los labios la mande a operar ya tengo Barbie nueva
Sin Yolanda los culos blanquitos marca Holanda
Nomas, ven la lambo y que tranza

Pura influencer es lo qué hay
Tu novio licuachelas yo domperi
Pa que muevas esas
Mi mero mole lana y mas princesas
Tussi y cocaine

Como bruce wayne
En la noche me ven
Las que mueven el culo en tiktok
Yo las tengo moviéndome el culo ahorita
Un millón diamantes en los dientes como katy perry caras las morritas

Dom perignon lady gaga ravioli en Italia
Con una argentina
Vale verga 30 K
Aquí volamos a pura farandulita

Ando en el Cadillac one sobra calidad siempre pa onde volteas
Traigo en una bolsa el Everest la nieve
Sobra y el sueño no llega
Claves como en el vice city culos polvo y feria aquí son enternas

La shorty se hizo los labios la mande a operar ya tengo Barbie nueva
Sin Yolanda los culos blanquitos marca Holanda
Nomas ven la lambo y que tranza

"Lavell Crawford Hilariously On Diddy, Drake’s BBL, Katt Williams, Kevin Hart, Jordan & Breaking Bad","Lavell Crawford stops by Club Shay Shay for a laugh-filled discussion with Shannon Sharpe. First, Lavell discusses his friendly feud with Bruce Bruce (which started over Bruce Bruce’s comments on Club Shay Shay) over their similar sizes and recounts getting kicked off a plane for being belligerently drunk.

He shares his weight loss journey, driven by health complications and his sister, talks about his past food addiction and claims he would’ve eaten 300 hamburgers for $3000 at his heaviest. Lavell addresses the growing use of Ozempic for weight loss, especially among kids, and humorously compares Drake’s alleged BBL to a candy apple. He expresses his preference for cuisine over fast food, inventing the “Real Mac” and appreciating vegan salads.

Lavell also incidents of joke theft involving Katt Williams, Cedric the Entertainer and Tyler Perry, and reveals his supportive nature by spilling that he often writes jokes and punchlines for other comedians for free. He talks about the opportunity Steve Harvey gave him at the Hoodie Awards, reminisces about encounters with Rickey Smiley, Michael Jordan, and Charles Oakley, and shares his love story with his wife and their journey through struggles and successes.

Then he recalls the moment he realized he was really big after a doctor recognized his need to lose weight just from a phone call. Lavell explains he decided to lose weight for his family and himself.

He also opens up about discovering his “dad” wasn’t straight or his biological father and finding his real dad through a private investigator. Lavell talks about landing his role in Breaking Bad and how it changed his comedy career. He shares experiences with crazy fans and working with stars like Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Robin Williams.

Encouraging Shannon to try stand-up, Lavell compares his potential to Steve Austin. Lavell talks about the jealousy some comedians feel toward the success of Adam Sandler, Ray Romano, and Jerry Seinfeld. He addresses Katt Williams' accusations on Club Shay Shay and humorously suggests Shannon make a sex tape to beat allegations sparked by people like Mike Epps. He also discusses being curved by Boosie Badass at the airport.

Finally, Lavell shares his Mount Rushmore of comedians, proudly placing himself among the greats. This episode of Club Shay Shay is a rollercoaster of laughter, personal revelations, and profound insights into the world of comedy and beyond.

Lyrics / Letra:
 
(Uh Uhh Yaa)
(Uh Uhh Yaa)

(Ra Rauw)
(Estoy de vuelta baby)
(Una nueva era)
(Ey)

Siento que el cielo estoy tocando
tu sonrisa me lleva
cómo nos estamos mirando 
ya duda no me queda
 
Y con esta nota ehh
es más fácil en nada pensar
ella y yo nos dejamos llevar
Mañana podemos aterrizar
te puedes ir o te puedes quedar,
nunca estuve en busca de na’
pero por ahora esta noche

Siento que el cielo estoy tocando 
(Uhh Uhh Yaa)
Ay si supieras en lo que estoy pensando 
(Uhh Uhh Yaa)

(Ey, tú me gustas)
(Rauw)

Ella se suelta cuando está afuera 
Sus labios pegan con su cartera (Ey)
Se la pongo donde ella prefiera 
Conquistarte, dime quién pudiera

Y si me lo das todo
Por ti del paracaídas yo me arrojo
Mi corazón antes estaba gris, ahora es rojo
Los dos sufrimos de amor, ni modo

Que con esta nota ehh
Es más fácil en nada pensar
Ella y yo nos dejamos llevar
Mañana podemos aterrizar
Te puedes ir o me puedes dejar
Nunca estuve en busca de na’
Pero por ahora esta noche

Siento que el cielo estoy tocando 
(Uh Uhh Yaa)
Ay si supieras en lo que estoy pensando 
(Uh Uhh Yaa)

Esto es Cosa Nuestra y no creo que lo puedas entender 

Uhh Ohh Ohhh Ohh
Siento que puedo volar 
Uhh Ohh Ohh Ohhh
Baby I’m touching the sky 

Y si me lo das todo, 
Por ti del paracaídas yo me arrojo. 
Mi corazón antes estaba gris, ahora es rojo
Los dos sufrimos de amor, ni modo.

Que con esta nota ehh
(Uhh Uhh Yaa)

How Did Tim Duncan Agree to This Interview...? The Richard Jefferson & Larry Show | Ep. 1,"In 2016, Tim Duncan retired from the league as a 5-time NBA Champion, a two-time NBA MVP, and a Hall of Fame athlete. Despite his career accolades, Tim rarely makes public appearances or sits down for press interviews. Lucky for us we knew there were two people in the world Tim could never say no to...fellow teammate Richard Jefferson and his co-host Larry O'Brien (aka the NBA trophy). Don't worry we are as confused as you are. I mean I highly doubt anyone is even reading this and if you are...chill bro. 

Welcome to the first episode of The Richard & Larry Show!

Grupo Frontera ft. Maluma - POR QUÉ SERÁ (Video Oficial)

Letra:
Quisiera volver al día en que nos conocimos... pa no ir 
Quisiera un botón para apagar los sentimientos 
Y no sufrir tanto 
Ya no sufrir tanto 

¿Por qué será? que cuando quiero querer 
Conmigo quieren jugar, cuando algo quiero tener  
Y me empiezo a ilusionar, termina siendo un fracaso 
Otro amor que se me rompe en pedazos  

Pensándolo bien 
Yo nací pa querer a la que no me quiere
Y eso duele 

¿Por qué será? que cuando quiero querer 
Conmigo quieren jugar
Cuando algo quiero tener  
Y me empiezo a ilusionar, termina siendo un fracaso 
Otro amor que se me rompe en pedazos  

Pensándolo bien 
Yo nací pa querer a la que no me quiere
Y eso duele

Yo quisiera no querer 
Y que tú me quisieras
Pa que sientas lo que siento
Y así mismo te doliera 
¿Por qué me pagas así? si yo te quise de a deveras
¿Qué te pasó? ¿que te cambió? tú así no eras
 
¿Desde cuando en tu corazón yo ando sobrando?
Si en el mío eras la que mandabas, yo pensaba que me amabas

¿Por qué será? que cuando quiero querer 
Conmigo quieren jugar
Cuando algo quiero tener y me empiezo a ilusionar termina siendo un fracaso 
Otro amor que se me rompe en pedazos  

Pensándolo bien 
Yo nací pa querer a la que no me quiere
Y eso duele

¿Por qué será? que cuando quiero querer 
Conmigo quieren jugar
Cuando algo quiero tener y me empiezo a ilusionar, termina siendo un fracaso 
Otro amor que se me rompe en pedazos

Pensándolo bien 
Yo nací pa querer a la que no me quiere
Y eso duele

LYRICS
Reaching out on my way home,
You can be so cold, I’ll try again,
You make me sad and second-guess myself,
You can be so cold, midwest indigo.

Running late so I didn’t have the time,
To scrape the frosted windshield,
Like we’re barely scraping by,
Concentrate on the little gap in the ice,
That seems to be about as wide as our chances.

Did you pull up yet?
Not yet.
Did you forget we’re tight on time?

Cloud coverage matched my outfit to a knife,
I requested counsel with the counselor,
And he canceled twice,
It's a different blue, it’s deeper than it’s been,
I’ll be pulling into the parking lot before the heat kicks in.

What’s your ETA?
Two minutes.
Chill out man, we’re right on time.

And I want love and sunny days,
I’m a bit too old to run away,
You make me sad and second-guess myself,
You can be so cold… midwest indigo.

Black holes are inevitable predictions of general relativity—our best theory of space, time and gravity. But they clash in multiple ways with quantum mechanics, our equally successful description of the subatomic world. One such clash is the black hole information paradox—and a proposed solution—black hole complementarity—may forced us to radically rethink what it even means to say that something to exists.

LYRICS
Seems I get in my own way,
The more I think, the less I say,
I hope I communicate the craving,

Now I see intentions don’t mean much.

Say enough, say enough,
Did I let her know, let her know,
If I found my body in chains,
I’d lay down and wait,
And hope she looks for me.

She just wants to catch a wave,
Ride it out to the end of her days,
I hope that I can satiate the craving,

Now I see a gesture don’t mean much.

Say enough, say enough,
Did I let her know, let her know,
If I found my body in chains,
I’d lay down and wait,
’Cause it’s the fear of the unknown,
That cripples every step we take,
And I just hate to put this on her,

But I swear that I will give more than I take away.

Lyrics 

I think he knows
When I play with him like that
When I say it to him like that
Have my way with him like that

I think he knows
When I play with him like that
When I say it to him like that
That he’s coming right back

She’s a provocateur
Dancefloor connoisseur 
Shit week so Friday for sure
Tell the girls we’re taking a detour

Give him hell, yeah
Give these boys hell, yeah
She does it well, ah yeah
I do it myself, ah yeah

Cigarette, candy necklace on my hips
Butterfly thats on my wrist
Put your hands on me like this
Major glow, head to toe
PT, she’s glossy
Give him one kiss, just softly
Tease him and get him off me 

I think he knows
When I play with him like that
When I say it to him like that
Have my way with him like that 

I think he knows
When I play with him like that
When I say it to him like that
That he’s coming right back

He dripping down on my Bustier
Like ice cream while Ashanti playing in the amg 
Let it rain on me 
He fucking up my headboard
So I’m on my knees like dear lord please pray for me 
Save the grace for me
Say boy 
What-what u want 
I give u that uh- that uh- that uh 
Bdwwwww
Shoot in my mouth 
Shoot in my shit like uh and one 
Ahhh yeeee a yeahhh
On the real imma take his soul
Imma take him from his hoes
On the real i think he knows 

I think he knows
When I play with him like that
I think he knows 
When I say it to him like that 

He’s wrapped around my pinky finger,
Watching the way I move
More drunk on power than on liquor 
And he knows it’s true 

When I play with him like that
When I play with him like that 
That he’s coming right back

To celebrate the release of “Bridgerton” Season 3, we had the cast — Nicola Coughlan, Luke Newton, Claudia Jessie, and Luke Thompson — swing by for the puppy interview and answer some burning questions. What were their favorite BTS memories from filming the new season? Have they ever caught fans watching “Bridgerton” in public? And what’s the random item Claudia keeps stealing from set? We literally covered it all. Watch all the cuteness now! #Bridgerton #NicolaCoughlan #LukeNewton

The Greatest Game We've Ever Played ft. Bob Does Sports,"We're back with our boys from Bob Does Sports and man do we have a good for you. It's BDS vs Fore Play, but with a major twist. Two man scramble and Fat Perez is our mulligan for BOTH teams. If you don't like where you end up, you can call in FP and he can hit a shot for you. However, in order to unlock the almighty Perez you have to rip a Fireball nip. One shot per hole so some strategy is involved. This one gets crazy folks.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it the ""opportunity of a lifetime.""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPOHf20slZg/default.jpg
